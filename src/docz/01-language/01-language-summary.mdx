# The JavaScript Language

[home](/)

## Summary

JavaScript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled (Interpreted) at runtime (“on the fly”). <br />
It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine (“host environment” ie: Node.js).

## General

### JavaScript is:

  - high-level.
  - multi-paradigm.
  - interpreted and sometimes compiled at runtime with a just-in-time (JIT) compiler.
  - dynamically and weakly typed.
  - prototype-based, object oriented with first-class functions.
 <br />

 **Note:** You may sometimes hear JavaScript described as an intrepreted language but technically, JavaScript is NOT an interpreted language;
 technically it depends on the implementation. See notes on Google V8 Engine (which uses a JIT complier) below. 


 ### What else?

 - Data types are assumed (inferred) (ie assigned to variables) automatically. You don’t have to define that some variable must hold a certain data type (ie a number) like you do in C#, Java or TypeScript.
 - Data types are also not set in stone, they can change at run-time (ie start as a string and change to a number).


 ### History

 - Developed by Brandan Eich at Netscape in 1995 in 10 days. (you didn't have to flex so hard Brandan!)

 ### Programming Language Features:

 #### Types

 **Type Checking** is the process of verifying and enforcing the constraints of types.
 Type Checking may occur either at compile-time (a static check) or at run-time (dynamic check).


 #### Statically typed languages
 - Statically typed programming languages do type checking at compile-time (as opposed to run-time).
 - They do more processing at compile time but give better run-time performance.
 - Are less prone to runtime errors but provide less flexibility to programmer.

 > C# <br />
 > type `variableName` = value; <br />
 > int num = 13;


 #### Dynamically typed languages
 - Dynamically typed programming languages do type checking at run-time as opposed to compile-time.
 - Types are associated with a value, rather than an expression.
 - Usually have more efficient compiler/interpreters, but type-checking at run-time affects performance.
 - Provides more flexibility but more prone to runtime errors.

 > JavaScript  <br />
 > var | const | let variableName = value; <br />
 > let num = 13; <br />
 > num2 = 19;

 * In JavaScript you can also declare a variable with using the var, const or let keyword.


 #### Strong and Weak Typed Systems
 Languages are often colloquially referred to as strongly typed or weakly typed.
 In fact, there is no universally accepted definition of what these terms mean.
 No programming language fits any of these definitions 100%.

 Strong/Weak Typing is about how strictly types are distinguished (e.g. whether the language tries to do an implicit conversion, i.e. coersion, from strings to numbers).


 #### Strongly Typed
 A strongly-typed language is one in which variables are bound to specific data types, and will result in type errors 
 if types do not match up as expected in the expression — regardless of when type checking occurs.

 Examples: Python, Java, C#

 #### Weakly Typed (loosely typed)
 (In) A weakly typed language (the interpreter or compiler) will attempt to implicitly convert (coerse) a value from one type to another.

 Examples: JavaScript
